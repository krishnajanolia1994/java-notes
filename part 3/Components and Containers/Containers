Containers
Swing defines two types of containers. The first are top-level containers: JFrame, JApplet,
JWindow, and JDialog. These containers do not inherit JComponent. They do, however,
inherit the AWT classes Component and Container. Unlike Swingâ€™s other components,
which are lightweight, the top-level containers are heavyweight. This makes the top-level
containers a special case in the Swing component library.

The second type of containers supported by Swing are lightweight containers. Lightweight
containers do inherit JComponent.

lightweight container can be contained within another container.

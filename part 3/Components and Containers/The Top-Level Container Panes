The Top-Level Container Panes
Each top-level container defines a set of panes. At the top of the hierarchy is an instance of
JRootPane. JRootPane is a lightweight container whose purpose is to manage the other
panes. It also helps manage the optional menu bar. The panes that comprise the root pane
are called the glass pane, the content pane, and the layered pane.

The glass pane enables you to manage mouse events that affect the entire container.

The layered pane is an instance of JLayeredPane. The layered pane allows components
to be given a depth value. This value determines which component overlays another.

In general, Swing components are derived from the JComponent class.
JComponent provides the functionality that is common to all components. For example, JComponent supports the
pluggable look and feel. JComponent inherits the AWT classes Container and Component.
Thus, a Swing component is built on and compatible with an AWT component.

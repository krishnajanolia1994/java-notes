Design Patterns for Events
Beans use the delegation event model that was discussed earlier in this book. Beans can
generate events and send them to other objects. These can be identified by the following
design patterns, where T is the type of the event:
public void addTListener(TListener eventListener)
public void addTListener(TListener eventListener)
throws java.util.TooManyListenersException
public void removeTListener(TListener eventListener)

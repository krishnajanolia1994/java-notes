Advantages of Java Beans
The following list enumerates some of the benefits that Java Bean technology provides for
a component developer:
• A Bean obtains all the benefits of Java’s “write-once, run-anywhere” paradigm.
• The properties, events, and methods of a Bean that are exposed to another application
can be controlled.
• Auxiliary software can be provided to help configure a Bean. This software is only
needed when the design-time parameters for that component are being set. It does
not need to be included in the run-time environment.
• The configuration settings of a Bean can be saved in persistent storage and restored
at a later time.
• A Bean may register to receive events from other objects and can generate events
that are sent to other objects.

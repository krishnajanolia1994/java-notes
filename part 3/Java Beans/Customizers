Customizers
A Bean developer can provide a customizer that helps another developer configure the Bean. A
customizer can provide a step-by-step guide through the process that must be followed to use
the component in a specific context. Online documentation can also be provided. A Bean
developer has great flexibility to develop a customizer that can differentiate his or her product
in the marketplace.

Radio Buttons
Radio buttons are a group of mutually exclusive
buttons, in which only one button can be selected at
any one time. They are supported by the JRadioButton class, which extends JToggleButton.
JRadioButton provides several constructors. The one used in the example is shown here:
JRadioButton(String str)

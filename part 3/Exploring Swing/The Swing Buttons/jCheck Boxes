Check Boxes
The JCheckBox class provides the functionality of a check box. Its immediate superclass is
JToggleButton, which provides support for two-state buttons, as just described. JCheckBox
defines several constructors. The one used here is
JCheckBox(String str)
It creates a check box that has the text specified by str as a label. Other constructors let you
specify the initial selection state of the button and specify an icon.

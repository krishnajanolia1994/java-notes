JButton
The JButton class provides the functionality of a push button. You have already seen a
simple form of it in the preceding chapter. JButton allows an icon, a string, or both to be
associated with the push button. Three of its constructors are shown here:
JButton(Icon icon)
JButton(String str)
JButton(String str, Icon icon)

setActionCommand( )

getActionCommand( ):--The action command identifies the button.

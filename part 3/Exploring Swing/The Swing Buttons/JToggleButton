JToggleButton
A useful variation on the push button is called a
toggle button. A toggle button looks just like a push
button, but it acts differently because it has two
states: pushed and released. That is, when you press
a toggle button, it stays pressed rather than popping
back up as a regular push button does. When you
press the toggle button a second time, it releases
(pops up). Therefore, each time a toggle button is
pushed, it toggles between its two states.

Like JButton, JToggleButton generates an action event each time it is pressed. Unlike
JButton, however, JToggleButton also generates an item event. This event is used by those
components that support the concept of selection. When a JToggleButton is pressed in, it is
selected. When it is popped out, it is deselected

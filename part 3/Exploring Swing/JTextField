JTextField
JTextField is the simplest Swing text component. It is also probably its most widely used text
component. JTextField allows you to edit one line of text. It is derived from JTextComponent,
which provides the basic functionality common to Swing text components. JTextField uses
the Document interface for its model.
Three of JTextFieldâ€™s constructors are shown here:
JTextField(int cols)
JTextField(String str, int cols)
JTextField(String str)
Here, str is the string to be initially presented, and cols is the number of columns in the text
field. If no string is specified, the text field is initially empty. If the number of columns is not
specified, the text field is sized to fit the specified string.

To obtain the text currently in the text field, call getText( ).

JLabel and ImageIcon
JLabel is Swingâ€™s easiest-to-use component. It creates a label and was introduced in the
preceding chapter. Here, we will look at JLabel a bit more closely. JLabel can be used to
display text and/or an icon. It is a passive component in that it does not respond to user
input. JLabel defines several constructors. Here are three of them:
JLabel(Icon icon)
JLabel(String str)
JLabel(String str, Icon icon, int align)


The ImageIcon constructor used by the example in this section:
ImageIcon(String filename)
It obtains the image in the file named filename.
The icon and text associated with the label can be obtained by the following methods:
Icon getIcon( )
String getText( )
The icon and text associated with a label can be set by these methods:
void setIcon(Icon icon)
void setText(String str)

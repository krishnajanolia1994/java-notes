Compute the Paintable Area
When drawing to the surface of a component, you must be careful to restrict your output
to the area that is inside the border. Although Swing automatically clips any output that
will exceed the boundaries of a component, it is still possible to paint into the border, which
will then get overwritten when the border is drawn. To avoid this, you must compute the
paintable area of the component.

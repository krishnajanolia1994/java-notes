. Because the AWT components use native code resources, they are referred to as heavyweight.

The use of native peers led to several problems.

First, because of variations between
operating systems, a component might look, or even act, differently on different platforms.
This potential variability threatened the overarching philosophy of Java: write once, run
anywhere.

Second, the look and feel of each component was fixed.) and could not be (easily) changed

Third, the use of heavyweight components caused some frustrating restrictions.


To owercome above problem swing was introduced in 1997

Before moving on, it is necessary to make one important point: although Swing eliminates
a number of the limitations inherent in the AWT, Swing does not replace it. Instead, Swing
is built on the foundation of the AWT. This is why the AWT is still a crucial part of Java.

Swing Components Are Lightweight
With very few exceptions, Swing components are lightweight. This means that they are written
entirely in Java and do not map directly to platform-specific peers., 
because lightweight components do not translate into native peers, the look and
feel of each component is determined by Swing, not by the underlying operating system. This
means that each component will work in a consistent manner across all platforms.

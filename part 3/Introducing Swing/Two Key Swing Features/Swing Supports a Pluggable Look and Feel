Swing Supports a Pluggable Look and Feel
Swing supports a pluggable look and feel (PLAF). Because each Swing component is rendered
by Java code rather than by native peers, the look and feel of a component is under the
control of Swing.
it is possible to “plug in” a new look and feel for any given component without creating any
side effects in the code that uses that component.

JComboBox
Swing provides a combo box (a combination of a text field and a drop-down list) through
the JComboBox class. A combo box normally displays one entry, but it will also display a
drop-down list that allows a user to select a different entry. You can also create a combo box

JComboBox uses the ComboBoxModel. Mutable combo boxes (those whose entries can
be changed) use the MutableComboBoxModel.

items can be dynamically added to the list of choices via the addItem( ) method, shown here:
void addItem(Object obj)

JComboBox generates an action event when the user selects an item from the list.
JComboBox also generates an item event when the state of selection changes, which occurs
when an item is selected or deselected. Thus, changing a selection means that two item
events will occur: one for the deselected item and another for the selected item

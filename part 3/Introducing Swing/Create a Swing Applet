Create a Swing Applet
The second type of program that commonly uses Swing is the applet. Swing-based applets
are similar to AWT-based applets, but with an important difference: A Swing applet extends
JApplet rather than Applet. JApplet is derived from Applet. Thus, JApplet includes all of
the functionality found in Applet and adds support for Swing. JApplet is a top-level Swing
container, which means that it is not derived from JComponent. Because JApplet is a
top-level container, it includes the various panes described earlier. This means that all
components are added to JApplet’s content pane in the same way that components are
added to JFrame’s content pane.

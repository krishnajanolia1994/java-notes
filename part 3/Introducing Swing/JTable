JTable
JTable is a component that displays rows and columns of data. You can drag the cursor
on column boundaries to resize columns.

Like JTree, JTable has many classes and interfaces associated with it. These are
packaged in javax.swing.table.


JTable does
not provide any scrolling capabilities of its own. Instead, you will normally wrap a JTable
inside a JScrollPane.
JTable supplies several constructors. The one used here is
JTable(Object data[ ][ ], Object colHeads[ ])

JTable relies on three models. The first is the table model, which is defined by the
TableModel interface. This model defines those things related to displaying data in a
two-dimensional format. The second is the table column model, which is represented by
TableColumnModel. JTable is defined in terms of columns, and it is TableColumnModel that
specifies the characteristics of a column. These two models are packaged in javax.swing.table.
The third model determines how items are selected, and it is specified by the
ListSelectionModel, which was described when JList was discussed.

A JTable can generate several different events. The two most fundamental to a table’s
operation are ListSelectionEvent and TableModelEvent. A ListSelectionEvent is generated
when the user selects something in the table.

A TableModelEvent is fired when that table’s
data changes in some way. Handling these events requires a bit more work


1. Create an instance of JTable.
2. Create a JScrollPane object, specifying the table as the object to scroll.
3. Add the table to the scroll pane.
4. Add the scroll pane to the content pane.

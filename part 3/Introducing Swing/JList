JList
In Swing, the basic list class is called JList. It supports the selection of one or more items
from a list. Although the list often consists of strings, it is possible to create a list of just
about any object that can be displayed. JList is so widely used in Java that it is highly
unlikely that you have not seen one before.
JList provides several constructors. The one used here is
JList(Object[ ] items)

A JList generates a ListSelectionEvent when the user makes or changes a selection.
This event is also generated when the user deselects an item. It is handled by implementing
ListSelectionListener. This listener specifies only one method, called valueChanged( ),
which is shown here:

By default, a JList allows the user to select multiple ranges of items within the list, but
you can change this behavior by calling setSelectionMode( ), which is defined by JList. It is
shown here:
void setSelectionMode(int mode)
Here, mode specifies the selection mode. It must be one of these values defined by
ListSelectionModel:
SINGLE_SELECTION
SINGLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION
MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION

You can obtain the index of the first item selected, which will also be the index of the only
selected item when using single-selection mode, by calling getSelectedIndex( ), shown here:
int getSelectedIndex( )

setSelectionMode(ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION);

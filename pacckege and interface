difference between package and interface :---
                     Methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations.
                     A Java abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behaviour.
                     Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. 
                     ... A Java class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one abstract class.

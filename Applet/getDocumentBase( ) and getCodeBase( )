getDocumentBase( ) and getCodeBase( )
Often, you will create applets that will need to explicitly load media and text. Java will
allow the applet to load data from the directory holding the HTML file that started the
applet (the document base) and the directory from which the appletâ€™s class file was loaded
(the code base). These directories are returned as URL objects (described in Chapter 20) by
getDocumentBase( ) and getCodeBase( ). They can be concatenated with a string that names
the file you want to load. To actually load another file, you will use the showDocument( )
method defined by the AppletContext interface, discussed in the next section.
The following applet illustrates these methods:

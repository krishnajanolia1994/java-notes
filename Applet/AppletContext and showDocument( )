To allow your
applet to transfer control to another URL, you must use the showDocument( ) method defined
by the AppletContext interface.
AppletContext is an interface that lets you get information from the applet’s execution environment

Within an applet, once you have obtained the applet’s context, you can bring another
document into view by calling showDocument( ). This method has no return value and
throws no exception if it fails, so use it carefully. There are two showDocument( ) methods.
The method showDocument(URL) displays the document at the specified URL. The
method showDocument(URL, String) displays the specified document at the specified
location within the browser window.

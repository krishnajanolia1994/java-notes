In a Java window, the upper-left
corner is location 0,0.
To set the background color of an appletâ€™s window, use setBackground( ).
A good place to set the foreground and background colors is in the init( ) method. Of
course, you can change these colors as often as necessary during the execution of your applet.

You can obtain the current settings for the background and foreground colors by calling
getBackground( ) and getForeground( ), respectively. They are also defined by Component
and are shown here:
Color getBackground( )
Color getForeground( )

paint( )
The paint( ) method is called each time your appletâ€™s output must be redrawn. This situation
can occur for several reasons. For example, the window in which the applet is running may
be overwritten by another window and then uncovered. Or the applet window may be
minimized and then restored. paint( ) is also called when the applet begins execution.
Whatever the cause, whenever the applet must redraw its output, paint( ) is called. The paint( )
method has one parameter of type Graphics. This parameter will contain the graphics context,
which describes the graphics environment in which the applet is running. This context is used
whenever output to the applet is required.

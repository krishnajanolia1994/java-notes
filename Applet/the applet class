Applet provides all necessary
support for applet execution, such as starting and stopping. It also provides methods that
load and display images, and methods that load and play audio clips.

First, applets are event driven.

In those
situations in which your applet needs to perform a repetitive task on its own (for example,
displaying a scrolling message across its window), you must start an additional thread of
execution.

start( )
The start( ) method is called after init( ). It is also called to restart an applet after it has been
stopped. Whereas init( ) is called once—the first time an applet is loaded—start( ) is called
each time an applet’s HTML document is displayed onscreen. So, if a user leaves a web page
and comes back, the applet resumes execution at start( ).

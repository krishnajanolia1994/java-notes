Remember, one of the fundamental architectural constraints imposed on an
applet is that it must quickly return control to the run-time system. It cannot create a loop
inside paint( ) that repeatedly scrolls the banner,
Whenever your applet needs
to update the information displayed in its window, it simply calls repaint( ).

The repaint( ) method has four forms. Letâ€™s look at each one, in turn. The simplest version
of repaint( ) is shown here:
void repaint( )
This version causes the entire window to be repainted. The following version specifies a region
that will be repainted:
void repaint(int left, int top, int width, int height)

Multiple
requests for repainting that occur within a short time can be collapsed by the AWT in a
manner such that update( ) is only called sporadically
One solution to this
problem is to use the following forms of repaint( ):
void repaint(long maxDelay)
void repaint(long maxDelay, int x, int y, int width, int height)

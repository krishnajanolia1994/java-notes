Other Scanner Features
Scanner defines several other methods in addition to those already discussed. One that is
particularly useful in some circumstances is findInLine( ). Its general forms are shown here:
String findInLine(Pattern pattern)
String findInLine(String pattern)
This method searches for the specified pattern within the next line of text. If the pattern is
found, the matching token is consumed and returned. Otherwise, null is returned


Related to findInLine( ) is findWithinHorizon( ) It is shown here:
String findWithinHorizon(Pattern pattern, int count)
String findWithinHorizon(String pattern, int count)
This method attempts to find an occurrence of the specified pattern within the next count
characters. If successful, it returns the matching pattern. Otherwise, it returns null. If count is
zero, then all input is searched until either a match is found or the end of input is encountered.

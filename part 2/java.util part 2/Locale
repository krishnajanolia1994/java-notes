Locale
The Locale class is instantiated to produce objects that describe a geographical or cultural
region. It is one of several classes that provide you with the ability to write programs that
can execute in different international environments

For example, the expression Locale.CANADA represents the Locale object for Canada.
The constructors for Locale are
Locale(String language)
Locale(String language, String country)
Locale(String language, String country, String data)

This sets the default locale to that specified by localeObj.
Some other interesting methods are the following:
final String getDisplayCountry( )
final String getDisplayLanguage( )
final String getDisplayName( )

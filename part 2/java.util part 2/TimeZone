TimeZone
Another time-related class is TimeZone. The TimeZone class allows you to work with time
zone offsets from Greenwich mean time (GMT), also referred to as Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC). It also computes daylight saving time. TimeZone only supplies the default constructor.
A sampling of methods defined by TimeZone is given in Table 18-5.

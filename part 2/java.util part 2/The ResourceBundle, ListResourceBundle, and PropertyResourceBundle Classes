The java.util package includes three classes that aid in the internationalization of your
program. The first is the abstract class ResourceBundle. It defines methods that enable you
to manage a collection of locale-sensitive resources, such as the strings that are used to label
the user interface elements in your program. You can define two or more sets of translated
strings that support various languages, such as English, German, or Chinese, with each
translation set residing in its own bundle. You can then load the bundle appropriate to the
current locale and use the strings to construct the programâ€™s user interface.

Random
The Random class is a generator of pseudorandom numbers. These are called pseudorandom
numbers because they are simply uniformly distributed sequences. Random defines the
following constructors:
Random( )
Random(long seed)

If you initialize a Random object with a seed, you define the starting point for the random
sequence. If you use the same seed to initialize another Random object, you will extract the
same random sequence.

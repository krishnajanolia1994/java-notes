GregorianCalendar
GregorianCalendar is a concrete implementation of a Calendar that implements the normal
Gregorian calendar with which you are familiar. The getInstance( ) method of Calendar
will typically return a GregorianCalendar initialized with the current date and time in the
default locale and time zone.

GregorianCalendar defines two fields: AD and BC. These represent the two eras defined
by the Gregorian calendar.
There are also several constructors for GregorianCalendar objects. The default,
GregorianCalendar( ), initializes the object with the current date and time in the default
locale and time zone. Three more constructors offer increasing levels of specificity:
GregorianCalendar(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth)
GregorianCalendar(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hours,
int minutes)
GregorianCalendar(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hours,
int minutes, int seconds)

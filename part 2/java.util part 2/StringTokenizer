StringTokenizer
The processing of text often consists of parsing a formatted input string. Parsing is the division
of text into a set of discrete parts, or tokens, which in a certain sequence can convey a semantic
meaning. The StringTokenizer class provides the first step in this parsing process, often
called the lexer (lexical analyzer) or scanner. StringTokenizer implements the Enumeration
interface. Therefore, given an input string, you can enumerate the individual tokens contained
in it using StringTokenizer.

To use StringTokenizer, you specify an input string and a string that contains delimiters.
Delimiters are characters that separate tokens

The StringTokenizer constructors are shown here:
StringTokenizer(String str)
StringTokenizer(String str, String delimiters)
StringTokenizer(String str, String delimiters, boolean delimAsToken)
In all versions, str is the string that will be tokenized. In the first version, the default delimiters
are used. In the second and third versions, delimiters is a string that specifies the delimiters.
In the third version, if delimAsToken is true, then the delimiters are also returned as tokens
when the string is parsed. Otherwise, the delimiters are not returned. Delimiters are not
returned as tokens by the first two forms.

The hasMoreTokens( ) method returns true while there are more tokens to
be extracted

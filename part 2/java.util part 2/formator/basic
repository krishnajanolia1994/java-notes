At the core of Javaâ€™s support for creating formatted output is the Formatter class. It provides
format conversions that let you display numbers, strings, and time and date in virtually any
format you like. It operates in a manner similar to the C/C++ printf( ) function, which means
that if you are familiar with C/C++, then learning to use Formatter will be very easy. It also
further streamlines the conversion of C/C++ code to Java. If you are not familiar with C/C++,
it is still quite easy to format data

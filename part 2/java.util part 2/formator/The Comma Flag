The Comma Flag
When displaying large numbers, it is often useful to add grouping separators, which in
English are commas. For example, the value 1234567 is more easily read when formatted
as 1,234,567. To add grouping specifiers, use the comma (,) flag. For example,

fmt.format("%,.2f", 4356783497.34);
creates this string:
4,356,783,497.34

There is a convenient shorthand called a relative index that enables you to reuse the
argument matched by the preceding format specifier. Simply specify < for the argument
index.

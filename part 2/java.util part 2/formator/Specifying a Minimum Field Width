Specifying a Minimum Field Width
An integer placed between the % sign and the format conversion code acts as a minimum
field-width specifier.

If you want to pad with 0’s, place
a 0 before the field-width specifier. For example, %05d will pad a number of less than five
digits with 0’s so that its total length is five.

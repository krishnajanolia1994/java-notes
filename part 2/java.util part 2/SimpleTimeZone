SimpleTimeZone
The SimpleTimeZone class is a convenient subclass of TimeZone. It implements TimeZoneâ€™s
abstract methods and allows you to work with time zones for a Gregorian calendar. It also
computes daylight saving time.
SimpleTimeZone defines four constructors. One is
SimpleTimeZone(int timeDelta, String tzName)
This constructor creates a SimpleTimeZone object. The offset relative to Greenwich mean
time (GMT) is timeDelta. The time zone is named tzName.

Scanning Basics
Once you have created a Scanner, it is a simple matter to use it to read formatted input.
In general, a Scanner reads tokens from the underlying source that you specified when the
Scanner was created

1. Determine if a specific type of input is available by calling one of Scanner’s
   hasNextX methods, where X is the type of data desired.
2. If input is available, read it by calling one of Scanner’s nextX methods.
3. Repeat the process until input is exhausted.

The program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process, until the
user enters the string “done”. It then stops input and displays the average of the numbers.
Here is a sample run:

The Scanner Constructors
Scanner defines the constructors shown in Table 18-14. In general, a Scanner can be
created for a String, an InputStream, a File, or any object that implements the Readable
or ReadableByteChannel interfaces. Here are some examples.
The following sequence creates a Scanner that reads the file Test.txt:
FileReader fin = new FileReader("Test.txt");
Scanner src = new Scanner(fin);

Factory Methods
The InetAddress class has no visible constructors. To create an InetAddress object, you
have to use one of the available factory methods

Three commonly used InetAddress factory methods are
shown here:
static InetAddress getLocalHost( )
throws UnknownHostException
static InetAddress getByName(String hostName)
throws UnknownHostException
static InetAddress[ ] getAllByName(String hostName)
throws UnknownHostException
The getLocalHost( ) method simply returns the InetAddress object that represents the local
host. The getByName( ) method returns an InetAddress for a host name passed to it. If these
methods are unable to resolve the host name, they throw an UnknownHostException.

On the Internet, it is common for a single name to be used to represent several machines.
In the world of web servers, this is one way to provide some degree of scaling. The
getAllByName( ) factory method returns an array of InetAddresses that represent all of
the addresses that a particular name resolves to. It will also throw an UnknownHostException
if it can’t resolve the name to at least one address.

can’t resolve the name to at least one address.
InetAddress also includes the factory method getByAddress( ), which takes an IP
address and returns an InetAddress object

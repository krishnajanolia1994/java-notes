A socket identifies an endpoint in a network .Sockets are at the foundation of
modern networking because a socket allows a single computer to serve many different clients
at once, as well as to serve many different types of information.This is accomplished through
the use of a port, which is a numbered socket on a particular machine.

A server is allowed to accept multiple clients
connected to the same port number, although each session is unique. To manage multiple
client connections, a server process must be multithreaded or have some other means of
multiplexing the simultaneous I/O

Socket communication takes place via a protocol. Internet Protocol (IP) is a low-level
routing protocol that breaks data into small packets and sends them to an address across a
network, which does not guarantee to deliver said packets to the destination.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a higher-level protocol that manages to robustly string together
these packets, sorting and retransmitting them as necessary to reliably transmit data


User Datagram Protocol (UDP), sits next to TCP and can be used directly to
support fast, connectionless, unreliable transport of packets.

TCP/IP reserves the lower 1,024 ports for specific protocols.


Just as the numbers of an IP address describe a network hierarchy, the name of an Internet
address, called its domain name, describes a machineâ€™s location in a name space. For example,
www.osborne.com is in the COM domain (reserved for U.S. commercial sites); it is called
osborne (after the company name),

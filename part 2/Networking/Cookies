Cookies
The java.net package includes classes and interfaces that help manage cookies and can be used
to create a stateful (as opposed to stateless) HTTP session. The classes are CookieHandler,
CookieManager, and HttpCookie. The interfaces are CookiePolicy and CookieStore. All but
CookieHandler was added by Java SE 6. (CookieHandler was added by JDK 5.) The creation of
a stateful HTTP session is beyond the scope of this book.

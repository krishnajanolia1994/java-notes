DatagramPacket
DatagramPacket defines several constructors. Four are shown here:
DatagramPacket(byte data[ ], int size)
DatagramPacket(byte data[ ], int offset, int size)
DatagramPacket(byte data[ ], int size, InetAddress ipAddress, int port)
DatagramPacket(byte data[ ], int offset, int size, InetAddress ipAddress, int port)
The first constructor specifies a buffer that will receive data and the size of a packet. It is
used for receiving data over a DatagramSocket. The second form allows you to specify an
offset into the buffer at which data will be stored. The third form specifies a target address
and port, which are used by a DatagramSocket to determine where the data in the packet
will be sent. The fourth form transmits packets beginning at the specified offset into the
data. Think of the first two forms as building an “in box,” and the second two forms as
stuffing and addressing an envelope.
DatagramPacket defines several methods, including those shown here, that give access
to the address and port number of a packet, as well as the raw data and its length. In general,
the get methods are used on packets that are received and the set methods are used on
packets that will be sent.

Datagrams are bundles of information passed between machines. They are somewhat
like a hard throw from a well-trained but blindfolded catcher to the third baseman. Once
the datagram has been released to its intended target, there is no assurance that it will arrive
or even that someone will be there to catch it. Likewise, when the datagram is received,
there is no assurance that it hasnâ€™t been damaged in transit or that whoever sent it is still
there to receive a response.

TCP/IP Client Sockets
TCP/IP sockets are used to implement reliable, bidirectional, persistent, point-to-point,
stream-based connections between hosts on the Internet. A socket can be used to connect
Javaâ€™s I/O system to other programs that may reside either on the local machine or on any
other machine on the Internet.

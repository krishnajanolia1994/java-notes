TCP/IP Client Sockets
TCP/IP sockets are used to implement reliable, bidirectional, persistent, point-to-point,
stream-based connections between hosts on the Internet. A socket can be used to connect
Java’s I/O system to other programs that may reside either on the local machine or on any
other machine on the Internet.

The ServerSocket class is designed to be a “listener,” which waits for clients to
connect before doing anything.The Socket class is for
clients. It is designed to connect to server sockets and initiate protocol exchanges

You can gain access to the input and output streams associated with a Socket by use of
the getInputStream( ) and getOuptutStream( ) methods,

Several other methods are available, including connect( ), which allows you to specify a new
connection; isConnected( ), which returns true if the socket is connected to a server; isBound( ),
which returns true if the socket is bound to an address; and isClosed( ), which returns true
if the socket is closed.

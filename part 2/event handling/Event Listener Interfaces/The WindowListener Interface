The WindowListener Interface
This interface defines seven methods. The windowActivated( ) and windowDeactivated( )
methods are invoked when a window is activated or deactivated, respectively. If a window
is iconified, the windowIconified( ) method is called. When a window is deiconified,
the windowDeiconified( ) method is called. When a window is opened or closed, the
windowOpened( ) or windowClosed( ) methods are called, respectively. The windowClosing( )
method is called when a window is being closed. The general forms of these methods are
void windowActivated(WindowEvent we)
void windowClosed(WindowEvent we)
void windowClosing(WindowEvent we)
void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent we)
void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent we)
void windowIconified(WindowEvent we)
void windowOpened(WindowEvent we)

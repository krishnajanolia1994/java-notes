Event Listeners
A listener is an object that is notified when an event occurs. It has two major requirements.
First, it must have been registered with one or more sources to receive notifications about
specific types of events. Second, it must implement methods to receive and process these
notifications.

The methods that receive and process events are defined in a set of interfaces found in
java.awt.event.

Event Sources
A source is an object that generates an event. This occurs when the internal state of that object
changes in some way. Sources may generate more than one type of event.

A source must register listeners in order for the listeners to receive notifications about
a specific type of event. Each type of event has its own registration method. Here is the
general form:
public void addTypeListener(TypeListener el)

When an event
occurs, all registered listeners are notified and receive a copy of the event object. This is known
as multicasting the event.

event occurs, the registered listener is notified. This is known as unicasting the event.

A source must also provide a method that allows a listener to unregister an interest
in a specific type of event. The general form of such a method is this:
public void removeTypeListener(TypeListener el)

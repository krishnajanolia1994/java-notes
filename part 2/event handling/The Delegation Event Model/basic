The modern approach to handling events is based on the delegation event model, which defines
standard and consistent mechanisms to generate and process events. Its concept is quite simple:
a source generates an event and sends it to one or more listeners. In this scheme, the listener
simply waits until it receives an event. Once an event is received, the listener processes the event
and then returns.

The MouseEvent Class
There are eight types of mouse events. The MouseEvent class defines the following integer
constants that can be used to identify them:

MouseEvent is a subclass of InputEvent. Here is one of its constructors:
MouseEvent(Component src, int type, long when, int modifiers,
int x, int y, int clicks, boolean triggersPopup)

e NOBUTTON value indicates that no button was pressed or released.
Java SE 6 added three methods to MouseEvent that obtain the coordinates of the mouse
relative to the screen rather than the component. They are shown here:
Point getLocationOnScreen( )
int getXOnScreen( )
int getYOnScreen( )

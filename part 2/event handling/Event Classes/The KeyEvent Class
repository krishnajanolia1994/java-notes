The KeyEvent Class
A KeyEvent is generated when keyboard input occurs. There are three types of key events,
which are identified by these integer constants: KEY_PRESSED, KEY_RELEASED, and
KEY_TYPED.

KeyEvent is a subclass of InputEvent. Here is one of its constructors:
KeyEvent(Component src, int type, long when, int modifiers, int code, char ch)
Here, src is a reference to the component that generated the event.

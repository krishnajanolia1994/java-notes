The AdjustmentEvent Class
An AdjustmentEvent is generated by a scroll bar. There are five types of adjustment events.
The AdjustmentEvent class defines integer constants that can be used to identify them. The
constants and their meanings are shown here:

In addition, there is an integer constant, ADJUSTMENT_VALUE_CHANGED, that
indicates that a change has occurred.
Here is one AdjustmentEvent constructor:
AdjustmentEvent(Adjustable src, int id, int type, int data)

Here, src is a reference to the object that generated this event. The id specifies the event. The
type of the adjustment is specified by type, and its associated data is data.

The type of the adjustment event may be obtained by the getAdjustmentType( ) method. It
returns one of the constants defined by AdjustmentEvent. The general form is shown here:
int getAdjustmentType( )
The amount of the adjustment can be obtained from the getValue( ) method, shown here:
int getValue( )
For example, when a scroll bar is manipulated, this method returns the value represented
by that change.

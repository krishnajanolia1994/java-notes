The FocusEvent Class
A FocusEvent is generated when a component gains or loses input focus. These events are
identified by the integer constants FOCUS_GAINED and FOCUS_LOST.

ComponentEvent and has these constructors:
FocusEvent(Component src, int type)
FocusEvent(Component src, int type, boolean temporaryFlag)
FocusEvent(Component src, int type, boolean temporaryFlag, Component other)
The argument temporaryFlag is set to true if the focus event is temporary

You can determine the other component by calling getOppositeComponent( ),
shown here:
Component getOppositeComponent()

To test if a modifier was pressed at the time an event is generated, use the isAltDown( ),
isAltGraphDown( ), isControlDown( ), isMetaDown( ), and isShiftDown( ) methods. The
forms of these methods are shown here:
boolean isAltDown( )
boolean isAltGraphDown( )
boolean isControlDown( )
boolean isMetaDown( )
boolean isShiftDown( )

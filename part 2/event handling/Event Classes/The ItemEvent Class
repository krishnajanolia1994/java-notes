The ItemEvent Class
An ItemEvent is generated when a check box or a list item is clicked or when a checkable menu
item is selected or deselected. (Check boxes and list boxes are described later in this book.)
There are two types of item events, which are identified by the following integer constants:

In addition, ItemEvent defines one integer constant, ITEM_STATE_CHANGED, that
signifies a change of state.

ItemEvent has this constructor:
ItemEvent(ItemSelectable src, int type, Object entry, int state)

The getItem( ) method can be used to obtain a reference to the item that generated an
event. Its signature is shown here:
Object getItem( )

WindowEvent 
is a subclass of ComponentEvent. It defines several constructors. The
first is
WindowEvent(Window src, int type)
Here, src is a reference to the object that generated this event. The type of the event is type.
The next three constructors offer more detailed control:
WindowEvent(Window src, int type, Window other)
WindowEvent(Window src, int type, int fromState, int toState)
WindowEvent(Window src, int type, Window other, int fromState, int toState)

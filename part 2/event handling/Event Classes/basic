At the root of the Java event class hierarchy is EventObject, which is in java.util. It is the
superclass for all events. Its one constructor is shown here:

EventObject(Object src)

Here, src is the object that generates this event.


EventObject contains two methods: getSource( ) and toString( ). The getSource( ) method
returns the source of the event. Its general form is shown here:
Object getSource( )
As expected, toString( ) returns the string equivalent of the event.

The class AWTEvent, defined within the java.awt package, is a subclass of EventObject.
It is the superclass (either directly or indirectly) of all AWT-based events used by the delegation
event model.

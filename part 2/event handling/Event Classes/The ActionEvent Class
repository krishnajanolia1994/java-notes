The ActionEvent Class
An ActionEvent is generated when a button is pressed, a list item is double-clicked, or a
menu item is selected. The ActionEvent class defines four integer constants that can be
used to identify any modifiers associated with an action event: ALT_MASK, CTRL_MASK,
META_MASK, and SHIFT_MASK. In addition, there is an integer constant, ACTION_
PERFORMED, which can be used to identify action events.

ActionEvent has these three constructors:
ActionEvent(Object src, int type, String cmd)
ActionEvent(Object src, int type, String cmd, int modifiers)
ActionEvent(Object src, int type, String cmd, long when, int modifiers)
Here, src is a reference to the object that generated this event. The type of the event is specified
by type, and its command string is cmd. The argument modifiers indicates which modifier keys
( ALT , CTRL , META , and/or SHIFT ) were pressed when the event was generated. The when
parameter specifies when the event occurred.
You can obtain the command name for the invoking ActionEvent object by using the
getActionCommand( ) method, shown here:
String getActionCommand( )
For example, when a button is pressed, an action event is generated that has a command
name equal to the label on that button.
The getModifiers( ) method returns a value that indicates which modifier keys ( ALT , CTRL ,
META , and/or SHIFT ) were pressed when the event was generated. Its form is shown here:
int getModifiers( )
The method getWhen( ) returns the time at which the event took place. This is called the
eventâ€™s timestamp. The getWhen( ) method is shown here:
long getWhen( )

The MouseListener Interface
This interface defines five methods. If the mouse is pressed and released at the same point,
mouseClicked( ) is invoked. When the mouse enters a component, the mouseEntered( )
method is called. When it leaves, mouseExited( ) is called. The mousePressed( ) and
mouseReleased( ) methods are invoked when the mouse is pressed and released, respectively.
The general forms of these methods are shown here:
void mouseClicked(MouseEvent me)
void mouseEntered(MouseEvent me)
void mouseExited(MouseEvent me)
void mousePressed(MouseEvent me)
void mouseReleased(MouseEvent me)

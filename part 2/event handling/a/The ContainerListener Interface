The ContainerListener Interface
This interface contains two methods. When a component is added to a container,
componentAdded( ) is invoked. When a component is removed from a container,
componentRemoved( ) is invoked. Their general forms are shown here:
void componentAdded(ContainerEvent ce)
void componentRemoved(ContainerEvent ce)

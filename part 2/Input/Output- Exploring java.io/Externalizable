Externalizable
The Java facilities for serialization and deserialization have been designed so that much of
the work to save and restore the state of an object occurs automatically. However, there are
cases in which the programmer may need to have control over these processes. For example,
it may be desirable to use compression or encryption techniques. The Externalizable interface
is designed for these situations.
The Externalizable interface defines these two methods:
void readExternal(ObjectInput inStream)
throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException
void writeExternal(Object

RandomAccessFile
RandomAccessFile encapsulates a random-access file. It is not derived from InputStream
or OutputStream. Instead, it implements the interfaces DataInput and DataOutput, which
define the basic I/O methods. It also implements the Closeable interface. RandomAccessFile
is special because it supports positioning requestsâ€”that is, you can position the file pointer
within the file. It has these two constructors:
RandomAccessFile(File fileObj, String access)
throws FileNotFoundException
RandomAccessFile(String filename, String access)
throws FileNotFoundException

In both cases, access determines what type
of file access is permitted

RandomAccessFile implements the standard input and output methods, which you can
use to read and write to random access files. It also includes some additional methods. One
is setLength( ). It has this signature:

void setLength(long len) throws IOException
This method sets the length of the invoking file to that specified by len. This method can be
used to lengthen or shorten a file. If the file is lengthened, the added portion is undefined.

Filtered Byte Streams
Filtered streams are simply wrappers around underlying input or output streams that
transparently provide some extended level of functionality. These streams are typically
accessed by methods that are expecting a generic stream, which is a superclass of the
filtered streams. Typical extensions are buffering, character translation, and raw data
translation. The filtered byte streams are FilterInputStream and FilterOutputStream. Their
constructors are shown here:
FilterOutputStream(OutputStream os)
FilterInputStream(InputStream is)
The methods provided in these classes are identical to those in InputStream and OutputStream.

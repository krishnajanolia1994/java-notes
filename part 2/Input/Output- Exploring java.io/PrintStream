PrintStream
The PrintStream class provides all of the output capabilities we have been using from the
System file handle, System.out, since the beginning of the book. This makes PrintStream
one of Javaâ€™s most often used classes. It implements the Appendable, Closeable, and
Flushable interfaces.
PrintStream defines several constructors. The ones shown next have been specified
from the start:
PrintStream(OutputStream outputStream)
PrintStream(OutputStream outputStream, boolean flushOnNewline)
PrintStream(OutputStream outputStream, boolean flushOnNewline,
String charSet)
Here, outputStream specifies an open OutputStream that will receive output.


PrintStream(File outputFile) throws FileNotFoundException
PrintStream(File outputFile, String charSet)
throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException
PrintStream(String outputFileName) throws FileNotFoundException
PrintStream(String outputFileName, String charSet)
throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException

PushbackInputStream
One of the novel uses of buffering is the implementation of pushback. Pushback is used on
an input stream to allow a byte to be read and then returned (that is, “pushed back”) to the
stream. The PushbackInputStream class implements this idea. It provides a mechanism to
“peek” at what is coming from an input stream without disrupting it.
PushbackInputStream has the following constructors:
PushbackInputStream(InputStream inputStream)
PushbackInputStream(InputStream inputStream, int numBytes)

FileInputStream
The FileInputStream class creates an InputStream that you can use to read bytes from a file.
Its two most common constructors are shown here:
FileInputStream(String filepath)
FileInputStream(File fileObj)
Either can throw a FileNotFoundException. Here, filepath is the full path name of a file, and
fileObj is a File object that describes the file.

FileInputStream overrides six
of the methods in the abstract class InputStream. The mark( ) and reset( ) methods are not
overridden, and any attempt to use reset( ) on a FileInputStream will generate an IOException.

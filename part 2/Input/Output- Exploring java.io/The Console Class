The Console Class
Java SE 6 adds the Console class. It is used to read from and write to the console, if one exists.
It implements the Flushable interface. Console is primarily a convenience class because most
of its functionality is available through System.in and System.out. However, its use can
simplify some types of console interactions, especially when reading strings from the console.
Console supplies no constructors. Instead, a Console object is obtained by calling
System.console( ), which is shown here:
static Console console( )

Console defines the methods shown in Table 19-5. Notice that the input methods, such as
readLine( ), throw IOError if an input error occurs.

Also notice the readPassword( ) methods. These methods let your application read a
password without echoing what is typed.

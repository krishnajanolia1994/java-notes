FileOutputStream
FileOutputStream creates an OutputStream that you can use to write bytes to a file. Its
most commonly used constructors are shown here:
FileOutputStream(String filePath)
FileOutputStream(File fileObj)
FileOutputStream(String filePath, boolean append)
FileOutputStream(File fileObj, boolean append)


Obj is a File object that describes the file. If append is true, the file is opened in append mode.
Creation of a FileOutputStream is not dependent on the file already existing.
FileOutputStream will create the file before opening it for output when you create the
object. In the case where you attempt to open a read-only file, an IOException will be
thrown.

The Closeable and Flushable Interfaces
Recently (with the release of JDK 5), two interfaces were added to java.io: Closeable and
Flushable. The interfaces are implemented by several of the I/O classes. Their inclusion
does not add new functionality to the stream classes. They simply offer a uniform way of
specifying that a stream can be closed or flushed.

Objects of a class that implements Closeable can be closed. It defines the close( ) method,
shown here:
void close( ) throws IOException

Objects of a class that implements Flushable can force buffered output to be written
to the stream to which the object is attached. It defines the flush( ) method, shown here:
void flush( ) throws IOException

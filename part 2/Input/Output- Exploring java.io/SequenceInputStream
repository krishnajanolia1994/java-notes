SequenceInputStream
The SequenceInputStream class allows you to concatenate multiple InputStreams. The
construction of a SequenceInputStream is different from any other InputStream. A
SequenceInputStream constructor uses either a pair of InputStreams or an Enumeration
of InputStreams as its argument:
SequenceInputStream(InputStream first, InputStream second)
SequenceInputStream(Enumeration <? extends InputStream> streamEnum)

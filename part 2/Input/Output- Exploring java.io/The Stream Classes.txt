The Stream Classes
Javaâ€™s stream-based I/O is built upon four abstract classes: InputStream, OutputStream,
Reader, and Writer. These classes were briefly discussed in Chapter 13. They are used to
create several concrete stream subclasses. Although your programs perform their I/O
operations through concrete subclasses, the top-level classes define the basic functionality
common to all stream classes.

InputStream and OutputStream are designed for byte streams. Reader and Writer are
designed for character streams

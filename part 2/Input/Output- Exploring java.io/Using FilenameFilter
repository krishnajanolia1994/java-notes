Using FilenameFilter
You will often want to limit the number of files returned by the list( ) method to include
only those files that match a certain filename pattern, or filter. To do this, you must use a
second form of list( ), shown here:
String[ ] list(FilenameFilter FFObj)
In this form, FFObj is an object of a class that implements the FilenameFilter interface.

FilenameFilter defines only a single method, accept( ), which is called once for each file
in a list. Its general form is given here:
boolean accept(File directory, String filename)
The accept( ) method returns true for files in the directory specified by directory that should
be included in the list (that is, those that match the filename argument), and returns false for
those files that should be excluded.

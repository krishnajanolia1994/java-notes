It deals directly with files and the file system.That is, the File class does not specify how
information is retrieved from or stored in files; it describes the properties of a file itself. A
File object is used to obtain or manipulate the information associated with a disk file, such
as the permissions, time, date, and directory path, and to navigate subdirectory hierarchies.

The following constructors can be used to create File objects:
File(String directoryPath)
File(String directoryPath, String filename)
File(File dirObj, String filename)
File(URI uriObj)

Here, directoryPath is the path name of the file, filename is the name of the file or subdirectory,
dirObj is a File object that specifies a directory, and uriObj is a URI object that describes
a file.

File defines many methods that obtain the standard properties of a File object. For example,
getName( ) returns the name of the file, getParent( ) returns the name of the parent directory,
and exists( ) returns true if the file exists, false if it does not.

BufferedInputStream
Buffering I/O is a very common performance optimization. Java’s BufferedInputStream class
allows you to “wrap” any InputStream into a buffered stream and achieve this performance
improvement.
BufferedInputStream has two constructors:
BufferedInputStream(InputStream inputStream)
BufferedInputStream(InputStream inputStream, int bufSize)

BufferedInputStream also supports the mark( ) and
reset( ) methods.

ByteArrayOutputStream
ByteArrayOutputStream is an implementation of an output stream that uses a byte array
as the destination. ByteArrayOutputStream has two constructors, shown here:
ByteArrayOutputStream( )
ByteArrayOutputStream(int numBytes)
In the first form, a buffer of 32 bytes is created. In the second, a buffer is created with
a size equal to that specified by numBytes. The buffer is held in the protected buf field
of ByteArrayOutputStream. The buffer size will be increased automatically, if needed.
The number of bytes held by the buffer is contained in the protected count field of
ByteArrayOutputStream.
The following example demonstrates ByteArrayOutputStream:

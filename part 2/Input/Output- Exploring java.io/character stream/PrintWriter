PrintWriter
PrintWriter is essentially a character-oriented version of PrintStream. It implements the
Appendable, Closeable, and Flushable interfaces. PrintWriter has several constructors.
The following have been supplied by PrintWriter from the start:
PrintWriter(OutputStream outputStream)
PrintWriter(OutputStream outputStream, boolean flushOnNewline)
PrintWriter(Writer outputStream)
PrintWriter(Writer outputStream, boolean flushOnNewline)

printWriter(File outputFile) throws FileNotFoundException
PrintWriter(File outputFile, String charSet)
throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException
PrintWriter(String outputFileName) throws FileNotFoundException
PrintWriter(String outputFileName, String charSet)
throws FileNotFoundException, UnsupportedEncodingException

PrintWriter supports the print( ) and println( ) methods for all types, including Object.
If an argument is not a primitive type, the PrintWriter methods will call the objectâ€™s toString( )
method and then output the result.
PrintWriter also supports the printf( ) method. It works the same way it does in the
PrintStream class described earlier: it allows you to specify the precise format of the data.
Here is how printf( ) is declared in PrintWriter:

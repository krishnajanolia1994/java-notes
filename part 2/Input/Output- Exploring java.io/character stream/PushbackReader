PushbackReader
The PushbackReader class allows one or more characters to be returned to the input stream.
This allows you to look ahead in the input stream. Here are its two constructors:
PushbackReader(Reader inputStream)
PushbackReader(Reader inputStream, int bufSize)


PushbackReader provides unread( ), which returns one or more characters to the invoking
input stream. It has the three forms shown here:
void unread(int ch)
void unread(char buffer[ ])
void unread(char buffer[ ], int offset, int numChars)

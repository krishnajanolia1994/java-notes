BufferedWriter
A BufferedWriter is a Writer that buffers ouput. Using a BufferedWriter can increase
performance by reducing the number of times data is actually physically written to the
output stream.
A BufferedWriter has these two constructors:
BufferedWriter(Writer outputStream)
BufferedWriter(Writer outputStream, int bufSize)

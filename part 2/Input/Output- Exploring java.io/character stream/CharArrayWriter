CharArrayWriter
CharArrayWriter is an implementation of an output stream that uses an array as the destination.
CharArrayWriter has two constructors, shown here:

CharArrayWriter( )
CharArrayWriter(int numChars)
In the first form, a buffer with a default size is created. In the second, a buffer is created with a
size equal to that specified by numChars. The buffer is held in the buf field of CharArrayWriter.
The buffer size will be increased automatically, if needed. The number of characters held by the
buffer is contained in the count field of CharArrayWriter. Both buf and count are protected
fields.

CharArrayReader
CharArrayReader is an implementation of an input stream that uses a character array as the
source. This class has two constructors, each of which requires a character array to provide
the data source:
CharArrayReader(char array[ ])
CharArrayReader(char array[ ], int start, int numChars)

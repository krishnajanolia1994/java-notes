Setting the Paint Mode
The paint mode determines how objects are drawn in a window. By default, new output to
a window overwrites any preexisting contents. However, it is possible to have new objects
XORed onto the window by using setXORMode( ), as follows:
void setXORMode(Color xorColor)
Here, xorColor specifies the color that will be XORed to the window when an object is drawn.
The advantage of XOR mode is that the new object is always guaranteed to be visible no matter
what color the object is drawn over.

Working with Color
Java supports color in a portable, device-independent fashion. The AWT color system allows
you to specify any color you want. It then finds the best match for that color, given the limits
of the display hardware currently executing your program or applet. Thus, your code does not
need to be concerned with the differences in the way color is supported by various hardware
devices. Color is encapsulated by the Color class.
As you saw in Chapter 21, Color defines several constants (for example, Color.black) to
specify a number of common colors. You can also create your own colors, using one of the
color constructors. Three commonly used forms are shown here:
Color(int red, int green, int blue)
Color(int rgbValue)
Color(float red, float green, float blue)

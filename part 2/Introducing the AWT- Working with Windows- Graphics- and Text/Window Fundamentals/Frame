Frame(p 667)
Frame encapsulates what is commonly thought of as a “window.” It is a subclass of Window
and has a title bar, menu bar, borders, and resizing corners. If you create a Frame object from
within an applet, it will contain a warning message, such as “Java Applet Window,” to the
user that an applet window has been created

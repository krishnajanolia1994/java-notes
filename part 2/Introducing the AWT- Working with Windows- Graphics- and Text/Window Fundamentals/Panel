Panel
The Panel class is a concrete subclass of Container. It doesnâ€™t add any new methods; it simply
implements Container. A Panel may be thought of as a recursively nestable, concrete screen
component. Panel is the superclass for Applet.

Once these components have been added, you can position and resize them
manually using the setLocation( ), setSize( ), setPreferredSize( ), or setBounds( ) methods
defined by Component.

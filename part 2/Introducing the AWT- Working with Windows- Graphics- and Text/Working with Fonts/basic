Working with Fonts
The AWT supports multiple type fonts. Years ago, fonts emerged from the domain of traditional
typesetting to become an important part of computer-generated documents and displays.
The AWT provides flexibility by abstracting font-manipulation operations and allowing for
dynamic selection of fonts.
Fonts have a family name, a logical font name, and a face name. The family name is the
general name of the font, such as Courier. The logical name specifies a category of font, such
as Monospaced. The face name specifies a specific font, such as Courier Italic.

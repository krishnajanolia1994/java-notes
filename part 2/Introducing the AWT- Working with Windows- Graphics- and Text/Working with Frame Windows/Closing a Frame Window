Closing a Frame Window
When using a frame window, your program must remove that window from the screen when
it is closed, by calling setVisible(false). To intercept a window-close event, you must implement
the windowClosing( ) method of the WindowListener interface. Inside windowClosing( ),
you must remove the window from the screen. The example in the next section illustrates
this technique.

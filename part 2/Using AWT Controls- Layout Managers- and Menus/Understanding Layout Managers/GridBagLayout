The location and size of each component in a grid bag are determined by a set of constraints
linked to it. The constraints are contained in an object of type GridBagConstraints. Constraints
include the height and width of a cell, and the placement of a component, its alignment, and its
anchor point within the cell.


nagers, it is still quite easy to use once you understand how it works.
GridBagLayout defines only one constructor, which is shown here:
GridBagLayout( )
GridBagLayout defines several methods, of which many are protected and not for general
use. There is one method, however, that you must use: setConstraints( ). It is shown here:
void setConstraints(Component comp, GridBagConstraints cons)

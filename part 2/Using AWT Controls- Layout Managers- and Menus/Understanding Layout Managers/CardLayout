CardLayout
The CardLayout class is unique among the other layout managers in that it stores several
different layouts. Each layout can be thought of as being on a separate index card in a deck
that can be shuffled so that any card is on top at a given time.

Thus, you must create a panel that contains the deck and a panel for each card in the deck. Next, you add to the
appropriate panel the components that form each card. You then add these panels to the panel
for which CardLayout is the layout manager.

When card panels are added to a panel, they are usually given a name. Thus, most of
the time, you will use this form of add( ) when adding cards to a panel:
void add(Component panelObj, Object name)

After you have created a deck, your program activates a card by calling one of the
following methods defined by CardLayout:
void first(Container deck)
void last(Container deck)
void next(Container deck)
void previous(Container deck)
void show(Container deck, String cardName)

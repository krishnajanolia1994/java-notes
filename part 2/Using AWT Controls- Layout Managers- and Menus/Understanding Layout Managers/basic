Each Container object has a layout manager associated with it. A layout manager is an
instance of any class that implements the LayoutManager interface. The layout manager is
set by the setLayout( ) method. If no call to setLayout( ) is made, then the default layout
manager is used. Whenever a container is resized (or sized for the first time), the layout
manager is used to position each of the components within it.
The setLayout( ) method has the following general form:
void setLayout(LayoutManager layoutObj)

Whenever the
container needs to be resized, the layout manager is consulted via its minimumLayoutSize( )
and preferredLayoutSize( ) methods. Each component that is being managed by a layout
manager contains the getPreferredSize( ) and getMinimumSize( ) methods.

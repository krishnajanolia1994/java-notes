Using Lists
The List class provides a compact, multiple-choice, scrolling selection list. Unlike the
Choice object, which shows only the single selected item in the menu, a List object can be
constructed to show any number of choices in the visible window. It can also be created to
allow multiple selections. List provides these constructors:
List( ) throws HeadlessException
List(int numRows) throws HeadlessException
List(int numRows, boolean multipleSelect) throws HeadlessException

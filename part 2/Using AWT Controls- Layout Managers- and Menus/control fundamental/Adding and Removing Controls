Adding and Removing Controls
To include a control in a window, you must add it to the window. To do this, you must first
create an instance of the desired control and then add it to a window by calling add( ), which
is defined by Container. The add( ) method has several forms. The following form is the
one that is used for the first part of this chapter:
Component add(Component compObj)


Here, compObj is an instance of the control that you want to add. A reference to compObj is
returned. Once a control has been added, it will automatically be visible whenever its parent
window is displayed.

Sometimes you will want to remove a control from a window when the control is no
longer needed. To do this, call remove( ). This method is also defined by Container. It has
this general form:
void remove(Component obj)

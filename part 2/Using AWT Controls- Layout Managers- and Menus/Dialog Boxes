Dialog Boxes
Often, you will want to use a dialog box to hold a set of related controls. Dialog boxes are
primarily used to obtain user input and are often child windows of a top-level window.
Dialog boxes donâ€™t have menu bars, but in other respects, they function like frame windows.
(You can add controls to them, for example, in the same way that you add controls to a
frame window.

When a modal dialog box is active,
all input is directed to it until it is closed. This means that you cannot access other parts of
your program until you have closed the dialog box.

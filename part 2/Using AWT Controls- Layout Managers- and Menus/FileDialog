FileDialog
Java provides a built-in dialog box that lets the user specify a file. To create a file dialog box,
instantiate an object of type FileDialog. This causes a file dialog box to be displayed. Usually,
this is the standard file dialog box provided by the operating system. Here are three
FileDialog constructors:
FileDialog(Frame parent)
FileDialog(Frame parent, String boxName)
FileDialog(Frame parent, String boxName, int how)

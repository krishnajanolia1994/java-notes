Using a TextField
The TextField class implements a single-line text-entry area, usually called an edit control.
Text fields allow the user to enter strings and to edit the text using the arrow keys, cut and
paste keys, and mouse selections. TextField is a subclass of TextComponent. TextField
defines the following constructors:
TextField( ) throws HeadlessException
TextField(int numChars) throws HeadlessException
TextField(String str) throws HeadlessException
TextField(String str, int numChars) throws HeadlessException

To obtain the string currently contained in the text field, call getText( ).
To set the text, call setText( ). These methods are as follows:

Your program can obtain the currently selected
text by calling getSelectedText( )

You can control whether the contents of a text field may be modified by the user by
calling setEditable( ). You can determine editability by calling isEditable( ). These methods
are shown here:
boolean isEditable( )
void setEditable(boolean canEdit)

You can disable the echoing of the characters as they are typed by calling
setEchoChar( ).

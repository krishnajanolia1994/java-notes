Using Buttons
Perhaps the most widely used control is the push button. A push button is a component that
contains a label and that generates an event when it is pressed. Push buttons are objects of
type Button. Button defines these two constructors:
Button( ) throws HeadlessException
Button(String str) throws HeadlessException

After a button has been created, you can set its label by calling setLabel( ). You can
retrieve its label by calling getLabel( ). These methods are as follows:
void setLabel(String str)
String getLabel( )

setActionCommand( ). This method changes the action command string, but does not affect
the string used to label the button. Thus, setting the action command enables the action
command and the label of a button to differ.

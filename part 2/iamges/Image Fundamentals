the Component class in java.awt has a factory method called createImage( )
that is used to create Image objects. (Remember that all of the AWT components are subclasses
of Component, so all support this method.)
The createImage( ) method has the following two forms:
Image createImage(ImageProducer imgProd)
Image createImage(int width, int height)

The concurrent API supplies a feature called an executor that initiates and controls the
execution of threads. As such, an executor offers an alternative to managing threads
through the Thread class.
At the core of an executor is the Executor interface. It defines the following method:
void execute(Runnable thread)
The thread specified by thread is executed.

CountDownLatch
Sometimes you will want a thread to wait until one or more events have occurred. To handle
such a situation, the concurrent API supplies CountDownLatch. A CountDownLatch is
initially created with a count of the number of events that must occur before the latch is
released. Each time an event happens, the count is decremented. When the count reaches zero,
the latch opens.
CountDownLatch has the following constructor:
CountDownLatch(int num)

To wait on the latch, a thread calls await( ), which has the forms shown here:
void await( ) throws InterruptedException
void await(long wait, TimeUnit tu) throws InterruptedException

To signal an event, call the countDown( ) method, shown next:
void countDown( )

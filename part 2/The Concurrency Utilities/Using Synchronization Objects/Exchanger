Exchanger
Perhaps the most interesting of the synchronization classes is Exchanger. It is designed
to simplify the exchange of data between two threads. The operation of an Exchanger is
astoundingly simple: it simply waits until two separate threads call its exchange( ) method.
When that occurs, it exchanges the data supplied by the threads.

Exchanger is a generic class that is declared as shown here:
Exchanger<V>

CyclicBarrier
A situation not uncommon in concurrent programming occurs when a set of two or more
threads must wait at a predetermined execution point until all threads in the set have reached that point.
To handle such a situation, the concurrent API supplies the CyclicBarrier class.
It enables you to define a synchronization object that suspends until the specified number
of threads has reached the barrier point.
CyclicBarrier has the following two constructors:
CyclicBarrier(int numThreads)
CyclicBarrier(int numThreads, Runnable action)

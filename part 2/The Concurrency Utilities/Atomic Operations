Atomic Operations
java.util.concurrent.atomic offers an alternative to the other synchronization features when
reading or writing the value of some types of variables. This package offers methods that
get, set, or compare the value of a variable in one uninterruptible (that is, atomic) operation.
This means that no lock or other synchronization mechanism is required.
Atomic operations are accomplished through the use of classes, such as AtomicInteger and
AtomicLong, and methods such as get( ), set( ), compareAndSet( ), decrementAndGet( ),
and getAndSet( ), which perform the action indicated by their names.

java.util.concurrent.atomic
java.util.concurrent.atomic facilitates the use of variables in a concurrent environment.
It provides a means of efficiently updating the value of a variable without the use of locks.

This is accomplished through the use of classes, such as AtomicInteger and AtomicLong,
and methods, such as compareAndSet( ), decrementAndGet( ), and getAndSet( ). These
methods execute as a single, non-interruptible operation.

Buffered Byte Streams
For the byte-oriented streams, a buffered stream extends a filtered stream class by attaching
a memory buffer to the I/O streams. This buffer allows Java to do I/O operations on more
than a byte at a time, hence increasing performance.

the buffered byte stream classes are
BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream. PushbackInputStream also implements
a buffered stream.

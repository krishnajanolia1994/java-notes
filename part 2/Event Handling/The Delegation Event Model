The Delegation Event Model
The modern approach to handling events is based on the delegation event model, which defines
standard and consistent mechanisms to generate and process events.Its concept is quite simple:
a source generates an event and sends it to one or more listeners. In this scheme, the listener
simply waits until it receives an event. Once an event is received, the listener processes the event
and then returns.The advantage of this design is that the application logic that processes events
is cleanly separated from the user interface logic that generates those events.In the delegation event model,
listeners must register with a source in order to receive an event notification.

To provide the greatest flexibility in their use, the collection interfaces allow some methods
to be optional. The optional methods enable you to modify the contents of a collection.
Collections that support these methods are called modifiable. Collections that do not allow
their contents to be changed are called unmodifiable. If an attempt is made to use one of these
methods on an unmodifiable collection, an UnsupportedOperationException is thrown. All
the built-in collections are modifiable.

Comparators
Both TreeSet and TreeMap store elements in sorted order. However, it is the comparator that
defines precisely what “sorted order” means. By default, these classes store their elements
by using what Java refers to as “natural ordering,” which is usually the ordering that you
would expect (A before B, 1 before 2, and so forth). If you want to order elements a different
way, then specify a Comparator when you construct the set or map. Doing so gives you the
ability to govern precisely how elements are stored within sorted collections and maps.
Comparator is a generic interface that has this declaration:
interface Comparator<T>
Here, T specifies the type of objects being compared

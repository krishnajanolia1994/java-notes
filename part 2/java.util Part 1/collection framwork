The Java Collections Framework standardizes the way in which groups of objects are handled
by your programs

Java provided ad hoc classes such as Dictionary,
Vector, Stack, and Properties to store and manipulate groups of objects

The Collections Framework was designed to meet several goals. First, the framework had
to be high-performance. The implementations for the fundamental collections (dynamic arrays,
linked lists, trees, and hash tables) are highly efficient.


Algorithms are another important part of the collection mechanism. Algorithms operate
on collections and are defined as static methods within the Collections class. Thus, they are
available for all collections. Each collection class need not implement its own versions. The
algorithms provide a standard means of manipulating collections.j

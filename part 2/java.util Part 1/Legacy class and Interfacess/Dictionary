Dictionary
Dictionary is an abstract class that represents a key/value storage repository and operates
much like Map. Given a key and value, you can store the value in a Dictionary object. Once
the value is stored, you can retrieve it by using its key. Thus, like a map, a dictionary can be
thought of as a list of key/value pairs. Although not currently deprecated, Dictionary is
classified as obsolete, because it is fully superseded by Map. However, Dictionary is still in
use and thus is fully discussed here.
With the advent of JDK 5, Dictionary was made generic. It is declared as shown here:
class Dictionary<K, V>

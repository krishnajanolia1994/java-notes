Vector
Vector implements a dynamic array. It is similar to ArrayList, but with two differences: Vector
is synchronized, and it contains many legacy methods that are not part of the Collections

The amount of extra
space allocated during each reallocation is determined by the increment that you specify
when you create the vector. If you don’t specify an increment, the vector’s size is doubled
by each allocation cycle.

Vector defines these protected data members:
int capacityIncrement;
int elementCount;
Object[ ] elementData;

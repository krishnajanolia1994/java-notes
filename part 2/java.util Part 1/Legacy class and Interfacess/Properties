Properties
Properties is a subclass of Hashtable. It is used to maintain lists of values in which the key
is a String and the value is also a String. The Properties class is used by many other Java
classes. For example, it is the type of object returned by System.getProperties( ) when
obtaining environmental values. Although the Properties class, itself, is not generic, several
of its methods are.
Properties defines the following instance variable:
Properties defaults;
This variable holds a default property list associated with a Properties object. Properties
defines these constructors:
Properties( )
Properties(Properties propDefault)

Properties also contains one deprecated method: save( ).
This was replaced by store( ) because save( ) did not handle errors correctly.

One useful capability of the Properties class is that you can specify a default property
that will be returned if no value is associated with a certain key

One of the most useful aspects of Properties is that the information contained in a Properties
object can be easily stored to or loaded from disk with the store( ) and load( ) methods.

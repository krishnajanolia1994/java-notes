Generics add the one feature that collections had been missing: type safety. Prior to generics,
all collections stored Object references, which meant that any collection could store any type
of object. Thus, it was possible to accidentally store incompatible types in a collection. Doing
so could result in run-time type mismatch errors. With generics, it is possible to explicitly
state the type of data being stored, and run-time type mismatch errors can be avoided.

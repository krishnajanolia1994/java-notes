Java SE 6 added the ArrayDeque class, which extends AbstractCollection and implements
the Deque interface. It adds no methods of its own. ArrayDeque creates a dynamic array
and has no capacity restrictions. (The Deque interface supports implementations that
restrict capacity, but does not require such restrictions.) ArrayDeque is a generic class that
has this declaration:
class ArrayDeque<E>

Here, E specifies the type of objects stored in the collection.
ArrayDeque defines the following constructors:
ArrayDeque( )
ArrayDeque(int size)
ArrayDeque(Collection<? extends E> c)

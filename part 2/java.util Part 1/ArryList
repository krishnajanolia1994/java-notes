The ArrayList class extends AbstractList and implements the List interface. ArrayList is a
generic class that has this declaration:

lass ArrayList<E>
Here, E specifies the type of objects that the list will hold.
ArrayList supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed

In essence, an ArrayList is a variable-length array
of object references. That is, an ArrayList can dynamically increase or decrease in size.

ArrayList has the constructors shown here:
ArrayList( )
ArrayList(Collection<? extends E> c)
ArrayList(int capacity)

The first constructor builds an empty array list. The second constructor builds an array list
that is initialized with the elements of the collection c. The third constructor builds an array
list that has the specified initial capacity.

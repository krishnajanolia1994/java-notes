The PriorityQueue Class
PriorityQueue extends AbstractQueue and implements the Queue interface. It creates a queue
that is prioritized based on the queueâ€™s comparator. PriorityQueue is a generic class that has
this declaration:
class PriorityQueue<E>
Here, E specifies the type of objects stored in the queue. PriorityQueues are dynamic, growing
as necessary.
PriorityQueue defines the six constructors shown here:
PriorityQueue( )
PriorityQueue(int capacity)
PriorityQueue(int capacity, Comparator<? super E> comp)
PriorityQueue(Collection<? extends E> c)
PriorityQueue(PriorityQueue<? extends E> c)
PriorityQueue(SortedSet<? extends E> c)

If no comparator is specified when a PriorityQueue is constructed, then the default
comparator for the type of data stored in the queue is used. The default comparator will order
the queue in ascending order

You can obtain a reference to the comparator used by a PriorityQueue by calling its
comparator( ) method, shown here:
Comparator<? super E> comparator( )

One word of caution: although you can iterate through a PriorityQueue using an iterator,
the order of that iteration is undefined. To properly use a PriorityQueue, you must call methods
such as offer( ) and poll( ), which are defined by the Queue interface.

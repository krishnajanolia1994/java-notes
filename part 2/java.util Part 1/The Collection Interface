Collection is a generic
interface that has this declaration:
interface Collection<E>
Here, E specifies the type of objects that the collection will hold

Collection extends the
Iterable interface. This means that all collections can be cycled through by use of the for-each
style for loop.

Collection declares the core methods that all collections will have. These methods are
summarized in Table 17-1

Several of these methods
can throw an UnsupportedOperationException. As explained, this occurs if a collection
cannot be modified. A ClassCastException is generated when one object is incompatible with
another, such as when an attempt is made to add an incompatible object to a collection. A
NullPointerException is thrown if an attempt is made to store a null object and null elements
are not allowed in the collection. An IllegalArgumentException is thrown if an invalid
argument is used. An IllegalStateException is thrown if an attempt is made to add an
element to a fixed-length collection that is full

Java provided ad hoc classes such as Dictionary,
Vector, Stack, and Properties to store and manipulate groups of objects. Although these classes
were quite useful, they lacked a central, unifying theme.

The Collections Framework was designed to meet several goals. First, the framework had
to be high-performance.

Second, the framework had to allow different types of
collections to work in a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability. Third,
extending and/or adapting a collection had to be easy

Beginning with the collection interfaces is necessary because they determine
the fundamental nature of the collection classes. Put differently, the concrete classes simply
provide different implementations of the standard interfaces


Here, E specifies the type of objects that the collection will hold. Collection extends the
Iterable interface.

The SortedMap interface extends Map. It ensures that the entries are maintained in ascending
order based on the keys. SortedMap is generic and is declared as shown here:
interface SortedMap<K, V>

Sorted maps allow very efficient manipulations of submaps (in other words, subsets of a
map). To obtain a submap, use headMap( ), tailMap( ), or subMap( ). To get the first key in
the set, call firstKey( ). To get the last key, use lastKey( ).

Each key in a HashMap must be unique.
When "adding a duplicate key" the old value (for the same key, as keys must be unique) is simply replaced;
see HashMap.put: 
Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map.
If the map previously contained a mapping for the key, the old value is replace

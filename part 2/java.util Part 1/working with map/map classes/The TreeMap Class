The TreeMap class extends AbstractMap and implements the NavigableMap interface.
It creates maps stored in a tree structure. A TreeMap provides an efficient means of storing
key/value pairs in sorted order and allows rapid retrieval. You should note that, unlike a
hash map, a tree map guarantees that its elements will be sorted in ascending key order.
TreeMap is a generic class that has this declaration:
class TreeMap<K, V>
Here, K specifies the type of keys, and V specifies the type of values.
The following TreeMap constructors are defined:
TreeMap( )
TreeMap(Comparator<? super K> comp)
TreeMap(Map<? extends K, ? extends V> m)
TreeMap(SortedMap<K, ? extends V> sm)

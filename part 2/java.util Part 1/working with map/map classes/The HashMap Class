The HashMap Class
The HashMap class extends AbstractMap and implements the Map interface. It uses a hash
table to store the map. This allows the execution time of get( ) and put( ) to remain constant
even for large sets. HashMap is a generic class that has this declaration:
class HashMap<K, V>
Here, K specifies the type of keys, and V specifies the type of values.
The following constructors are defined:
HashMap( )
HashMap(Map<? extends K, ? extends V> m)
HashMap(int capacity)
HashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio)

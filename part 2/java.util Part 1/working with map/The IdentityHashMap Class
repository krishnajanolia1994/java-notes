The IdentityHashMap Class
IdentityHashMap extends AbstractMap and implements the Map interface. It is similar to
HashMap except that it uses reference equality when comparing elements. IdentityHashMap
is a generic class that has this declaration:
class IdentityHashMap<K, V>
Here, K specifies the type of key, and V specifies the type of value. The API documentation
explicitly states that IdentityHashMap is not for general use.

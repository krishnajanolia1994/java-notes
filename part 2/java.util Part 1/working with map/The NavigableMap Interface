The NavigableMap Interface
The NavigableMap interface was added by Java SE 6. It extends SortedMap and declares
the behavior of a map that supports the retrieval of entries based on the closest match to a
given key or keys. NavigableMap is a generic interface that has this declaration:
interface NavigableMap<K,V>

Here, K specifies the type of the keys, and V specifies the type of the values associated with
the keys. In addition to the methods that it inherits from SortedMap, NavigableMap adds
those summarized in Table 17-12. Several methods throw a ClassCastException when
an object is incompatible with the keys in the map. A NullPointerException is thrown
if an attempt is made to use a null object and null keys are not allowed in the set. An
IllegalArgumentException is thrown if an invalid argument is used.

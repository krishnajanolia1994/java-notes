A map is an object that stores associations between keys and values, or key/value pairs. Given
a key, you can find its value. Both keys and values are objects. The keys must be unique, but
the values may be duplicated. Some maps can accept a null key and null values, others cannot.
There is one key point about maps that is important to mention at the outset: they donâ€™t
implement the Iterable interface

However, as you
will soon see, you can obtain a collection-view of a map, which does allow the use of either
the for loop or an iterator.

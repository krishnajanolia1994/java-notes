The Map.Entry Interface
The Map.Entry interface enables you to work with a map entry. Recall that the entrySet( )
method declared by the Map interface returns a Set containing the map entries. Each of these
set elements is a Map.Entry object. Map.Entry is generic and is declared like this:
interface Map.Entry<K, V>

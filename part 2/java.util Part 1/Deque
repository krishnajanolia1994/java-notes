The Deque interface was added by Java SE 6. It extends Queue and declares the behavior of
a double-ended queue. Double-ended queues can function as standard, first-in, first-out
queues or as last-in, first-out stacks. Deque is a generic interface that has this declaration:
interface Deque<E>

A Deque implementation can be capacity-restricted, which meansChapter 17:
java.util Part 1: The Collections Framework
that only a limited number of elements can be added to the deque.

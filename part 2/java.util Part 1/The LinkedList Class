The LinkedList class extends AbstractSequentialList and implements the List, Deque, and
Queue interfaces. It provides a linked-list data structure. LinkedList is a generic class that
has this declaration:
class LinkedList<E>

Here, E specifies the type of objects that the list will hold. LinkedList has the two constructors
shown here:
LinkedList( )
LinkedList(Collection<? extends E> c)

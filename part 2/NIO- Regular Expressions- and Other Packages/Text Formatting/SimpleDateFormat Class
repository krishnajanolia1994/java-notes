SimpleDateFormat Class
SimpleDateFormat is a concrete subclass of DateFormat. It allows you to define your own
formatting patterns that are used to display date and time information.
One of its constructors is shown here:
SimpleDateFormat(String formatString)
The argument formatString describes how date and time information is displayed. An example
of its use is given here:
SimpleDateFormat sdf = SimpleDateFormat("dd MMM yyyy hh:mm:ss zzz");


For numbers, the number of times a pattern letter is repeated determines how many digits
are presented. For example, hh:mm:ss can present 01:51:15, but h:m:s displays the same time
value as 1:51:15.
Finally, M or MM causes the month to be displayed as one or two digits. However, three
or more repetitions of M cause the month to be displayed as a text string.

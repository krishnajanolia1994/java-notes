Using split( )
You can reduce an input sequence into its individual tokens by using the split( ) method
defined by Pattern. One form of the split( ) method is shown here:
String[ ] split(CharSequence str)
It processes the input sequence passed in str, reducing it into tokens based on the delimiters
specified by the pattern.

The java.util.regex package supports regular expression processing. As the term is used
here, a regular expression is a string of characters that describes a character sequence.

There are two classes that support regular expression processing: Pattern and Matcher.
These classes work together. Use Pattern to define a regular expression. Match the pattern
against another sequence using Matcher

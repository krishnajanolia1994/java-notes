Pattern
The Pattern class defines no constructors. Instead, a pattern is created by calling the compile( )
factory method. One of its forms is shown here:
static Pattern compile(String pattern)

Here, pattern is the regular expression that you want to use. The compile( ) method transforms
the string in pattern into a pattern that can be used for pattern matching by the Matcher class.
It returns a Pattern object that contains the pattern.

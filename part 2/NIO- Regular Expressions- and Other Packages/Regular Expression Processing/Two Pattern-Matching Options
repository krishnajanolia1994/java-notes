Two Pattern-Matching Options
Although the pattern-matching techniques described in the foregoing offer the greatest
flexibility and power, there are two alternatives which you might find useful in some
circumstances. If you only need to perform a one-time pattern match, you can use the
matches( ) method defined by Pattern. It is shown here:
static boolean matches(String pattern, CharSequence str)
It returns true if pattern matches str and false otherwise.

You can also perform a pattern match by using the matches( ) method implemented by
String. It is shown here:
boolean matches(String pattern)

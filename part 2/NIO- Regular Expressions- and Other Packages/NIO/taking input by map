A second, and often easier, way to read a file is to map it to a buffer. The advantage to
this approach is that the buffer automatically contains the contents of the file. No explicit
read operation is necessary. To map and read the contents of a file, follow this general
procedure. First, open the file using FileInputStream. Next, obtain a channel to that file by
calling getChannel( ) on the file object. Then, map the channel to a buffer by calling map( )
on the FileChannel object. The map( ) method is shown here:
MappedByteBuffer map(FileChannel.MapMode how,
long pos, long size) throws IOException

For reading a file, use MapMode.READ_ONLY. To read and write, use MapeMode.READ_
WRITE. MapMode.PRIVATE causes a private copy of the file to be made, and changes to
the buffer do not affect the underlying file.

Charsets and Selectors
Two other entities used by NIO are charsets and selectors. A charset defines the way that
bytes are mapped to characters. You can encode a sequence of characters into bytes using
an encoder. You can decode a sequence of bytes into characters using a decoder. Charsets,
encoders, and decoders are supported by classes defined in the java.nio.charset package

A selector supports key-based, non-blocking, multiplexed I/O. In other words, selectors
enable you to perform I/O through multiple channels.

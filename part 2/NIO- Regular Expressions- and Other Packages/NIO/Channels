Channels
Channels are defined in java.nio.channels. A channel represents an open connection to an
I/O source or destination. You obtain a channel by calling getChannel( ) on an object that
supports channels. For example, getChannel( ) is supported by following I/O classes.

The specific type of channel returned depends upon the type of object getChannel( )
is called on. For example, when called on a FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, or
RandomAccessFile, getChannel( ) returns a channel of type FileChannel. When called
on a Socket, getChannel( ) returns a SocketChannel.

FileChannel also provides the map( ) method, which lets you
map a file to a buffer.

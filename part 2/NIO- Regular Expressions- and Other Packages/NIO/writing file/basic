Writing to a File
There are several ways to write to a file through a channel. Again, we will look at two. First,
you can write data to an output file through a channel, by using explicit write operations.
Second, if the file is opened for read/write operations, you can map the file to a buffer and
then write to that buffer. Changes to the buffer will automatically be reflected in the file.
Both ways are described here.

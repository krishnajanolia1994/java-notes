Using assert
Another relatively new addition to Java is the keyword assert. It is used during program
development to create an assertion, which is a condition that should be true during the
execution of the program.


The assert keyword has two forms. The first is shown here:
assert condition;
Here, condition is an expression that must evaluate to a Boolean result. If the result is true,
then the assertion is true and no other action takes place. If the condition is false, then the
assertion fails and a default AssertionError object is thrown.
The second form of assert is shown here:
assert condition : expr;
In this version, expr is a value that is passed to the AssertionError constructor. This value is
converted to its string format and displayed if an assertion fails. Typically, you will specify
a string for expr, but any non-void expression is allowed as long as it defines a reasonable
string conversion.

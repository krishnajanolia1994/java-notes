Native Methods
Although it is rare, occasionally you may want to call a subroutine that is written in a
language other than Java. Typically, such a subroutine exists as executable code for the CPU
and environment in which you are workingâ€”that is, native code.

Java provides the native keyword, which is used to declare native code methods.

The volatile modifier tells the compiler that the variable modified by volatile can be
changed unexpectedly by other parts of your program . One of these situations involves
multithreaded programs. (You saw an example of this in Chapter 11.) In a multithreaded
program, sometimes two or more threads share the same variable. For efficiency considerations,
each thread can keep its own, private copy of such a shared variable. The real (or master) copy of
the variable is updated at various times, such as when a synchronized method is entered.
. In some cases, all that really matters is
that the master copy of a variable always reflects its current state. To ensure this, simply specify
the variable as volatile

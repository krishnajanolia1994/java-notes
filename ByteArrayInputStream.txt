ByteArrayInputStream
ByteArrayInputStream is an implementation of an input stream that uses a byte array as
the source. This class has two constructors, each of which requires a byte array to provide the
data source:
ByteArrayInputStream(byte array[ ])
ByteArrayInputStream(byte array[ ], int start, int numBytes)
Here, array is the input source. The second constructor creates an InputStream from a
subset of your byte array that begins with the character at the index specified by start and
is numBytes long.
The following example creates a pair of ByteArrayInputStreams, initializing them with
the byte representation of the alphabet:

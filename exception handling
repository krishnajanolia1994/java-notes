exception :-A Java exception is an object that describes an exceptional (that is, error) condition that has
occurred in a piece of code. 


Although the default exception handler provided by the Java run-time system is useful for
debugging, you will usually want to handle an exception yourself. Doing so provides two
benefits. First, it allows you to fix the error. Second, it prevents the program from automatical termination


when you use multiple catch statements, it is important to remember that exception
subclasses must come before any of their superclasses This is because a catch statement
that uses a superclass will catch exceptions of that type plus any of its subclasses.

to fix the problem, reverse the order of the catch statements.(page no 211)

new is used to construct an instance of NullPointerException . Many of Javaâ€™s built-
in run-time exceptions have at least two constructors: one with no parameter and one that
takes a string parameter. When the second form is used, the argument specifies a string that
describes the exception. This string is displayed when the object is used as an argument to
print( )
or
println( )
. It can also be obtained by a call to
getMessage( )
, which is defined by

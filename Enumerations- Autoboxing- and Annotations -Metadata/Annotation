Beginning with JDK 5, a new facility was added to Java that enables you to embed
supplemental information into a source file. This information, called an annotation, does not
change the actions of a program. 

An annotation cannot include an extends clause. However, all annotation types
automatically extend the Annotation interfaceIt overrides hashCode( ),
equals( ), and toString( ), which are defined by Object. It also specifies annotationType( ),
which returns a Class object that represents the invoking annotation.

we can inisialise sring by string literal
String s2 = "abc"; // use string literal

string concatination
we can join two string by + and also we can add other data type exa.  String s= "hey u are "+ k +"year old" 

String Conversion and toString( )
When Java converts data into its string representation during concatenation, it does so by
calling one of the overloaded versions of the string conversion method valueOf( ) defined
by String

objects of classes that you create.
Every class implements toString( ) because it is defined by Object. However, the default
implementation of toString( ) is seldom sufficient. For most important classes that you create,
you will want to override toString( ) and provide your own string representations. Fortunately,
this is easy to do. The toString( ) method has this general form:
String toString( )
To implement toString( ), simply return a String object that contains the human-readable
string that appropriately describes an object of your class.
By overriding toString( ) for classes that you create, you allow them to be fully integrated
into Javaâ€™s programming environment. For example, they can be used in print( ) and println( )
statements and in concatenation expressions. The following program demonstrates this by
overriding toString( ) for the Box class:

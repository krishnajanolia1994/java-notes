StringBuffer is a peer class of String that provides much of the functionality of strings.
As you know, String represents fixed-length, immutable character sequences. In contrast,
StringBuffer represents growable and writeable character sequences. StringBuffer may have
characters and substrings inserted in the middle or appended to the end. StringBuffer will
automatically grow to make room for such additions and often has more characters preallocated
than are actually needed, to allow room for growth. Java uses both classes heavily, but many
programmers deal only with String and let Java manipulate StringBuffers behind the scenes
by using the overloaded + operator.

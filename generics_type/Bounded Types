In Stats, the average( ) method attempts to obtain the double version of each number in
the nums array by calling doubleValue( ). Because all numeric classes, such as Integer and
Double, are subclasses of Number, and Number defines the doubleValue( ) method, this
method is available to all numeric wrapper classes. The trouble is that the compiler has no
way to know that you are intending to create Stats objects using only numeric types. Thus,
when you try to compile Stats, an error is reported that indicates that the doubleValue( )
method is unknown. To solve this problem, you need some way to tell the compiler that
you intend to pass only numeric types to T. Furthermore, you need some way to ensure that
only numeric types are actually passed.

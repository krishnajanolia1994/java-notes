// Ambiguity caused by erasure on
// overloaded methods.
class MyGenClass<T, V> {
T ob1;
V ob2;
// ...
// These two overloaded methods are ambiguous
// and will not compile.
void set(T o) {
ob1 = o;
}
void set(V o) {
ob2 = o;
}
}


MyGenClass<String, String> obj = new MyGenClass<String, String>()
In this case, both T and V will be replaced by String. This makes both versions of set( )
identical, which is, of course, an error

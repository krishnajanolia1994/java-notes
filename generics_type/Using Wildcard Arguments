As useful as type safety is, sometimes it can get in the way of perfectly acceptable constructs.
For example, given the Stats class shown at the end of the preceding section, assume that
you want to add a method called sameAvg( ) that determines if two Stats objects contain
arrays that yield the same average, no matter what type of numeric data each object holds.
For example, if one object contains the double values 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, and the other object
contains the integer values 2, 1, and 3, then the averages will be the same. One way to
implement sameAvg( ) is to pass it a Stats argument, and then compare the average of that
argument against the invoking object, returning true only if the averages are the same. For
example, you want to be able to call sameAvg( ), as shown here:

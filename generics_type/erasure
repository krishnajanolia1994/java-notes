In general, here is how erasure works. When your Java code is compiled, all generic type
information is removed (erased). This means replacing type parameters with their bound
type, which is Object if no explicit bound is specified, and then applying the appropriate
casts (as determined by the type arguments) to maintain type compatibility with the types
specified by the type arguments. The compiler also enforces this type compatibility. This
approach to generics means that no type parameters exist at run time. They are simply a
source-code mechanism.

Java’s Automatic Conversions
When one type of data is assigned to another type of variable, an automatic type conversion
will take place if the following two conditions are met:
• The two types are compatible.
• The destination type is larger than the source type.


Casting Incompatible Types
int a;
byte b;
// ...
b = (byte) a;

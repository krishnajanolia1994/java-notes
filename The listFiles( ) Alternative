The listFiles( ) Alternative
There is a variation to the list( ) method, called listFiles( ), which you might find useful.
The signatures for listFiles( ) are shown here:
File[ ] listFiles( )
File[ ] listFiles(FilenameFilter FFObj)
File[ ] listFiles(FileFilter FObj)
These methods return the file list as an array of File objects instead of strings. The first method
returns all files, and the second returns those files that satisfy the specified FilenameFilter.
Aside from returning an array of File objects, these two versions of listFiles( ) work like their
equivalent list( ) methods.

The third version of listFiles( ) returns those files with path names that satisfy the specified
FileFilter. FileFilter defines only a single method, accept( ), which is called once for each file in a
list. Its general form is given here:
boolean accept(File path)
The accept( ) method returns true for files that should be included in the list (that is, those
that match the path argument), and false for those that should be excluded.

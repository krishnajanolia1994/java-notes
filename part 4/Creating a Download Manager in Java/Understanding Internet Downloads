The client, your browser, requests to download a file from a server on the Internet. The server
then responds by sending the requested file to your browser. In order for clients to communicate
with servers, they must have an established protocol for doing so. The most common protocols
for downloading files are File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
FTP is usually associated generically with exchanging files between computers, whereas
HTTP is usually associated specifically with transferring web pages and their related files
(that is, graphics, sounds, and so on). Over time, as the World Wide Web has grown in
popularity, HTTP has become the dominant protocol for downloading files from the Internet.
FTP is definitely not extinct, though.



The difference between these two forms lies in the way files can
be requested from servers. With the antiquated HTTP 1.0, a client can only request that a server
send it a file, whereas with HTTP 1.1, a client can request that a server send it a complete file or
only a specific portion of a file. This is the feature the Download Manager is built on.

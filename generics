What Are Generics?
At its core, the term generics means parameterized types. Parameterized types are important
because they enable you to create classes, interfaces, and methods in which the type of data
upon which they operate is specified as a parameter.

Because Object is the superclass of all other classes, an Object reference can refer to any type object.

With generics, all casts are automatic and implicit.
Thus, generics expand your ability to reuse code and let you do so safely and easily.
